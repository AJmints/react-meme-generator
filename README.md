# React Practice

Followed a course from freeCodeCamp that was an intro to React. This is the video I followed.
[React Course - Beginner's Tutorial for React JavaScript Library [2022]](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8)

In this, learned about React components, state, conditional rendering, React Forms, useEffect, side effects,
hooks, JSX, and various other bits about react and best practices.

In this video, we built a meme generator. I added routing to the page and then included all the lessons
that were important as a route to a page that highlighted that lesson. My src folder organization isn't
great with this project, but that is due to learning the foundations and getting a feel for what it's like
to work in React.

This course covered the basics of React. This project will be left in this state for future reference for
myself as I continue to learn more.
